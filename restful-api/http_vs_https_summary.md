# HTTP vs HTTPS

## Differences between HTTP and HTTPS

| Aspect            | HTTP                                               | HTTPS                                               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Encryption        | No encryption; data is sent in plain text          | Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS                    |
| Security          | Vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering          | Secure; protects data from being intercepted       |
| Default Port      | 80                                                 | 443                                                 |
| Certificate       | No certificate required                            | Requires SSL/TLS certificate                        |
| Typical Use       | Non-sensitive websites                             | Websites handling sensitive data (login, banking)   |
